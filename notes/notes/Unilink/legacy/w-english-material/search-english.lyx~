\begin_layout Section
The Reading of English Materials
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the development of science and technology, the use of English has become
 the norm in international academic exchanges.
 Top-notch papers are exclusively written in English, and internationally
 recognized classic books in the field of computer science are also authored
 in English.
 There are no Chinese translation versions available for these top-notch
 papers.
 Therefore, if one wishes to access information, it is essential to actively
 engage in reading English materials, rather than waiting for translated
 versions to be published.
 The mindset of "I am Chinese, I only read Chinese" no longer aligns with
 the current trends of development.
 To stay at the forefront of the era, the ability to read English materials
 is indispensable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reading English materials essentially involves "looking up unfamiliar words
 in the dictionary and repeatedly reading unfamiliar sentences." Nowadays,
 there are various online resources available to address urgent needs, such
 as vocabulary reference tools.
 However, the key to improving English reading skills lies in perseverance.
 It is common for all Chinese individuals to initially find reading English
 to be less efficient.
 If you observe experts around you effortlessly reading English materials,
 it is because they have long overcome these challenges.
 Quoting the words of Mr.
 Chen Daoxu: "Persist for a year, and you will notice a difference; persist
 for two years, and you will experience a significant transformation."

 But how do you establish axioms for these seemingly obvious things? If
 you delve deeper, you will realize that it is not simple at all! It is
 a complex system that encapsulates the wisdom of mathematicians!

Only solving the problems, getting a score of 90+ can be regarded as excellent.

 If you did not receive adequate training during the process, you will find

 Regardless of your current score, training is

Whatever be the detail with which you cram your student, the chance of his
 meeting in after life exactly that detail is almost infinitesimal; and
 if he does meet it, he will probably have forgotten what you taught him
 about it.
 The really useful training yields a comprehension of a few general principles
 with a thorough grounding in the way they apply to a variety of concrete
 details.
 In subsequent practice the men will have forgotten your particular details;
 but they will remember by an unconscious common sense how to apply principles
 to immediate circumstances.
 Your learning is useless to you till you have lost your textbooks, burnt
 your lecture notes, and forgotten the minutiae which you learned by heart
 for the examination.
 What, in the way of detail, you continually require will stick in your
 memory as obvious facts like the sun and the moon; and what you casually
 require can be looked up in any work of reference.
 The function of a University is to enable you to shed details in favor
 of principles.
 When I speak of principles I am hardly even thinking of verbal formulations.
 A principle which has thoroughly soaked into you is rather a mental habit
 than a formal statement.
 It becomes the way the mind reacts to the appropriate stimulus in the form
 of illustrative circumstances.
 Nobody goes about with his knowledge clearly and consciously before him.
 Mental cultivation is nothing else than the satisfactory way in which the
 mind will function when it is poked up into activity.

When you want to teach children to think, you begin by treating them seriously
 when they are little, giving them responsibilities, talking to them candidly,
 providing privacy and solitude for them, and making them readers and thinkers
 of significant thoughts from the beginning.
 That’s if you want to teach them to think.

我们都是活生生的人, 从小就被不由自主地教导用最小的付出获得最大的得到, 经常会忘记我们究竟要的是什么.
 我承认我完美主义, 但我想每个人心中都有那一份求知的渴望和对真理的向往, "大学"的灵魂也就在于超越世俗, 超越时代的纯真和理想 -- 我们不是要讨好企业的毕
业生, 而是要寻找改变世界的力量.

教育除了知识的记忆之外, 更本质的是能力的训练, 即所谓的training.
 而但凡training就必须克服一定的难度, 否则你就是在做重复劳动, 能力也不会有改变.
 如果遇到难度就选择退缩, 或者让别人来替你克服本该由你自己克服的难度, 等于是自动放弃了获得training的机会, 而这其实是大学专业教育最宝贵的部分.

这种"只要不影响我现在survive, 就不要紧"的想法其实非常的利己和短视: 你在专业上的技不如人, 迟早有一天会找上来, 会影响到你个人职业生涯的长远的发展
; 更严重的是, 这些以得过且过的态度来对待自己专业的学生, 他们的survive其实是以透支南大教育的信誉为代价的 -- 如果我们一定比例的毕业生都是这种情况
, 那么过不了多久, 不但那些混到毕业的学生也没那么容易survive了, 而且那些真正自己刻苦努力的学生, 他们的前途也会受到影响.
