Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following the college entrance examination, we have experienced a significant
 transformation in the way we acquire information.
 Instead of passively receiving information from teachers and parents, we
 have taken the initiative to actively comprehend various pieces of information.
 Now, let's explore some intriguing methods that enhance the efficiency
 and simplicity of our information retrieval process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Situation when the Internet was first invented
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After people gained access to the Internet, it became necessary to input
 specific web addresses in order to visit the websites they were familiar
 with.
 In their quest for a better browsing experience, people devised the following
 tricks:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Certain valuable websites will be placed into bookmark bars, facilitating
 convenient access for users.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There are online communities that enable us to share intriguing links with
 one another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Numerous websites have incorporated their own integrated search tools, allowing
 users to easily search for specific content within their platform.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Users leverage their own proactiveness, personal networks, and meticulously
 curated resource collections to make the process of information retrieval
 even more seamless and efficient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One suggestion is that: Is it feasible to devise a method for aggregating
 all this content into a single platform?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Question
If you were someone aiming to integrate all the available information at
 that time, how would you go about designing it?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The aspiration at that time was to have a single keyword that could connect
 all the knowledge together.
 Therefore, they needed a text-matching method to locate the relevant content
 from the existing resources.
 For example, let's assume the document library contains the following text:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Box Boxed
position "t"
hor_pos "c"
has_inner_box 1
inner_pos "t"
use_parbox 0
use_makebox 0
width "100col%"

\series bold
Setting breakpoints 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Breakpoints are set with the break command (abbreviated b).
 The gcc debugger convenience variable `$bpnum' records the number of the
 breakpoint you've set most recently; see section Convenience variables,
 for a discussion of what you can do with convenience variables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
You have several ways to say where the breakpoint should go ...
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, when using a search engine, it becomes crucial to differentiate
 keywords effectively.
 This way, searching for "gcc set breakpoints" would have a higher probability
 of being accurately matched.
 Now, you can understand the importance of properly distinguishing keywords
 in the context of using a search engine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though our search engines have become remarkably advanced, to the point
 where some can engage in natural language conversations, we can still achieve
 relatively satisfactory results by employing basic and straightforward
 operations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
One step Further
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the aforementioned methods are commendable, there are instances
 where they may not entirely fulfill our requirements.
 For instance, when using a tool on Linux, which is considered a relatively
 niche operating system compared to Windows, performing a keyword search
 may yield a plethora of results related to how the tool is used on Windows.
 This is not the desired outcome.
 Is there a method to address this issue?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There is a need to specify the inclusion or exclusion of certain keywords
 when conducting searches.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It is important to have the ability to restrict searches to a specific domain
 name.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed, modern search engines today have already incorporated such features
 and functionalities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Remark
Many reasonable and feasible functionalities have likely already been implemente
d in search engines.
 Therefore, the key is to find out where they are and use them straightforwardly
!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During idle moments, it can be beneficial to explore the links on credible
 homepages.
 These links have the potential to pleasantly surprise you with unexpected
 discoveries.

Example 1: Choosing College for the College Entrance Examination
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the month of June, every year, the entire nation gears up for the national
 college entrance examination.
 Following this significant milestone, a multitude of students will enter
 the realm of higher education.
 Certainly, during this transitional phase, I encourage everyone to reflect
 upon this everlasting question:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Question
Let's take a moment to review the questions you have previously asked.
 Are there any questions that, from a fresh perspective, could provide new
 insights or perspectives? For example, questions such as "Why is learning
 important?" or others alike.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, choosing a college major for the college entrance examination is
 perhaps the first significant life decision for many students (excluding
 those who have already made important choices, such as competitive students).
 As Mr.
 Zhu Fuhai once said, "Some argue that China's education system focuses
 on teaching but lacks cultivation.
 Schools merely impart tangible knowledge to children's minds rapidly, yet
 this knowledge fails to internalize as their inner qualities and abilities."
\end_layout

\end_inset

" featured in the public account "数林广记" , the topic is discussed thoroughly.
 I recommend giving it a read.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Indeed, this aspect is fully demonstrated when it comes to making choices.
 Now, let's approach this matter as we would solve any ordinary problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, we assume that everyone already has a clear idea of their desired
 college major.
 However, it is worth noting that in the current highly competitive environment,
 answering this question has become increasingly challenging.
 Therefore, if one doesn't have a definitive answer, it may require further
 exploration in the future.
 Taking the Henan province college entrance examination as an example, it
 allows candidates to select multiple parallel choices.
 So, what exactly are parallel choices?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When conducting a search on Baidu using relevant keywords, you will indeed
 come across various interpretations and explanations regarding parallel
 choices.
 However, the question of whether to trust these sources or not requires
 careful consideration.
 To enhance credibility, it is advisable to gather more information from
 reliable sources and consult trusted websites such as the Ministry of Education
 or the official website of the Chinese government.
 (One appoarch is to add a word to make the source more authoritative.)

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alternatively, you can refine your search by including specific domain names
 associated with trustworthy sources.
 This helps filter out less reliable information and prioritize content
 from reputable websites.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, we can refer to this link(
\begin_inset CommandInset href

The content highlighted in red indicates external links.
 You can click on the red text using a PDF reader on your computer to access
 the linked pages.
 If you use the middle mouse button (pressing the scroll wheel downwards),
 the linked page will open in a new window, which is quite convenient as
 you won't have to open the document again.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, there is still a lot of information within the document.
 In such cases, you can use the

.
 In the pop-up search box, enter ``平行志愿." This way, all instances of ``平行志愿."
 will be highlighted in yellow, making them easier to locate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Remark
Certainly, the majority of the current resources are sufficiently advanced
 to allow for ``random reading" , that is focusing on specific points of
 interest without being constrained by a strict linear progression.
 In the event that you encounter something unfamiliar, you can easily refer
 back to previously mentioned concepts or contextual information for further
 comprehension.
 This approach not only saves unnecessary trouble but also promotes efficient
 knowledge acquisition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After obtaining information from various sources, you now have an understanding
 of the college admission process.
 At this point, you may start estimating your scores and determining which
 school to attend.
 However, it's important to note that this process, while it may seem discouragi
ng, won't be of much help beyond satisfying curiosity.
 Attending university doesn't mean you can slack off and play all day; in
 fact, the academic workload in university can easily surpass that of three
 years in high school within a single academic year (or a single semester
 for some majors).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, you patiently wait for the provincial rankings to be released.
 In reality, each university has different admission plans for each region
 every year.
 This information is usually available in the publication "招生考试之友" (Admissions
 Examination Companion).
 However, as for the specific rankings, it's difficult to determine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To address this issue, there was a popular app at that time called "Quark
 Search." It claimed to provide information on the lowest provincial rankings
 for a specific major in recent years.
 The data used by the app was sourced from the Ministry of Education.
 It was like having a search engine specifically for this purpose.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once we have the lowest scores from the past few years and the enrollment
 information from "Enrollment and Examination Companion," we can explore
 the future development trends.
 Our knowledge of linear regression from high school can be of some assistance
 here, but we can leverage modern spreadsheet software such as Excel to
 make predictions and analyze the data more effectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking back, are there any areas where improvements can be made? This skill
 is essential and necessary because similar processes may be required in
 the future when choosing courses in university using the academic management
 system.
 To confidently face future challenges, take the time to fully experience
 and understand this process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(On a side note: back then, I also referred to the website 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href

\end_inset

 for guidance.
 I hope it can be helpful.
 But the greater help is in sharing how this idea came about, so that gradually
 you can come up with new ideas on your own.)

\begin_layout Standard
This story also takes place after the college entrance examination.
 After completing the exam, AUGPath found themselves with some free time
 at home and decided to revisit some topics in high school that they had
 always wanted to understand better.
 While casually browsing the internet, they stumbled upon the homepage of
 Professor 
\begin_inset CommandInset href

 and clicked on a course titled "Combinatorics" by Professor 
\begin_inset CommandInset href

\end_inset

.
 However, to their disappointment, the server hosting the course content
 was no longer functional.
 Determined to find a solution, they reached out to fellow students at Nanjing
 University and discovered that the professor had stopped teaching the course,
 and the server had been taken down.
 Now, the question was, how should they proceed in such a situation?

 Naturally, we received a clue: the "Internet Wayback Machine." With this

 course was taught.

However, the good news is that Professor Yin Yitong will be teaching "Combinator
