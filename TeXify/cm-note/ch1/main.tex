\section{The Tower of Hanoi}

\mkpt{Problem setup} There are 3 pegs and some disks stacked in decreasing order.

\begin{itemize}

    \item Rule. Move 1 disk at a time and never moving a large one to a smaller one
    \item Objective. Move all disk from one peg to another. 

\end{itemize}

\mkpt{Techique 1. Look at small examples} Transfer with 1, 2 and 3 disks is somehow obvious. 

\mkpt{Techique 2. Divide and conquer}
